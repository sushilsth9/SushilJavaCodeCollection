//    Here's a concise explanation of getter and setter methods:
//
//            ### Theory of Getter and Setter Methods
//
//    Getter and setter methods are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming in Java and other languages.
//    They are used to access (getter) and modify (setter) the private data members (fields) of a class. Here’s a breakdown of their purpose and usage:
//
//            1. **Encapsulation**: Getter and setter methods are key components of encapsulation,
//    which is the bundling of data (fields) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (a class in Java).
//    Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and protecting it from unauthorized access.
//
//            2. **Accessing Private Fields**: In Java, class fields are often declared as `private` to restrict direct access from outside the class.
//    This promotes data security and helps maintain the integrity of the class’s data.
//
//            3. **Getter Methods**:
//            - **Purpose**: Getter methods are used to retrieve (get) the current value of a private field from outside the class.
//            - **Naming Convention**: Getter methods typically start with the prefix `get` followed by the name of the field they retrieve.
//   - **Syntax**: Getter methods do not take any parameters and return the value of the corresponding field.
//
//    Example:
//            ```java
//    public String getName() {
//        return name;
//    }
//   ```
//
//           4. **Setter Methods**:
//            - **Purpose**: Setter methods are used to modify (set) the value of a private field from outside the class.
//            - **Naming Convention**: Setter methods typically start with the prefix `set` followed by the name of the field they modify.
//   - **Syntax**: Setter methods take a parameter that represents the new value to be assigned to the field and usually return `void`.
//
//    Example:
//            ```java
//    public void setName(String newName) {
//        this.name = newName;
//    }
//   ```
//
//           5. **Benefits**:
//            - **Controlled Access**: Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to class fields,
//            allowing validation and logic to be applied when setting or getting values.
//            - **Flexibility**: They enable flexible modification of class fields without directly exposing them,
//            facilitating future changes in implementation details without affecting external code.
//            - **Encapsulation**: By using getters and setters, encapsulation is enforced, enhancing code maintainability and reducing complexity.
//
//    In summary, getter and setter methods are essential tools in Java for achieving encapsulation,
//    enabling controlled access to private fields while promoting code flexibility and security.
//    They are integral to maintaining object-oriented principles and designing robust, reusable classes.
